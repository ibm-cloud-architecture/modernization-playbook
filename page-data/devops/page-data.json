You can tell which command to use based on the lock file at the root of your project (`yarn.lock` for yarn and `package-lock.json` for npm). For yarn, type `yarn dev` for npm, you’ll use `npm run dev`.\n\n3. **Make some changes!** – open [localhost:8000](//localhost:8000) in your browser to see your site running.\n\n   Each of the Items in your side bar correlates to a MDX file in your `src/pages/` directory. Navigate to a site and try editing the corresponding markdown file.
