Users interact directly with a browser-based interface and manage their cart to submit orders.  This application is built using the traditional [3-Tier Architecture](http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/3-tier-architecture.html) model, with an HTTP server, an application server, and a supporting database.\n\n![Phase 0 Application Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/apparch-pc-phase0-customerorderservices.png)\n\nThere are several components of the overall application architecture:\n- Starting with the database, the application leverages two SQL-based databases running on [IBM DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/).\n- The application exposes its data model through an [Enterprise JavaBean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans) layer, named **CustomerOrderServices**.  This components leverages the [Java Persistence API](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F) to exposed the backend data model to calling services with minimal coding effort.\n  - This build of the application uses JavaEE6 features for EJBs and JPA.\n- The next tier of the application, named **CustomerOrderServicesWeb**, exposes the necessary business APIs via REST-based web services.  This component leverages the [JAX-RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) libraries for creating Java-based REST services with minimal coding effort.\n  - This build of the application is using **JAX-RS 1.1** version of the respective capability.\n- The application's user interface is exposed through the **CustomerOrderServicesWeb** component as well, in the form of a Dojo Toolkit-based JavaScript application.  Delivering the user interface and business APIs in the same component is one major inhibitor our migration strategy will help to alleviate in the long-term.\n- Finally, there is an additional integration testing component, named **CustomerOrderServicesTest** that is built to quickly validate an application's build and deployment to a given application server.  This test component contains both **JPA** and **JAX-RS**-based tests.\n\n## How the Application was Modernized\nIn order to modernize the application from WebSphere ND v8.5.5 to the WebSphere Base v9 container running on OpenShift, the application went through **analysis**, **build** and **deploy** phases.\n\n### Analysis\n[IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/practices/learn/ibm-transformation-advisor) was used to analyze the existing Customer Order Services application and the WebSphere ND runtime. The steps were:\n\n1. [Install IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/learn/ibm-transformation-advisor) either with an Operator, locally, or as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Applications.\n\n2. Download and execute the ** Transformation Advisor Data Collector** against the existing WebSphere ND runtime.\n\n3. Upload the results of the data collection in to IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor and review the analysis. A screenshot of the analysis is shown below:\n\n  ![tWAS](images/tWAS-analyze/analysis2.png)\n\n  In the case of the **CustomerOrderServicesApp.ear** application, IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor has determined that the migration to WebSphere traditional is of **Simple** complexity and that there are six **Suggested Issues** that have been detected.\n\n4. Drilling down in to **Detailed Migration Analysis Report** that is part of the application analysis, it is worth noting that IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor has detected that there are issues with JPA. In this case it determined to use a non-default setting to avoid an issue where the second-level cache and the JPA configuration properties would need to be migrated. There is also a JAX-RS suggestion to use a non-default setting.  If not using the non-default settings there would be changes required with JAX-RS (to handle missing Apache and Wink packages). These two issues are related to a decision that was taken by IBM to allow WebSphere Application Server V9 to run in either JPA 2.0 or JPA 2.1 mode [as described here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/cejb_jpa21_behavior.html) and in either JAX-RS 2.0 or JAX-RS 1.1 mode [as described here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS7K4U_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/ae/rwbs_jaxrs_coexist.html). Transformation Advisor will make the needed changes for you in order to run in JPA 2.1 mode and JAX-RS 2.0 mode. The application **can run** in JPA 2.0 mode and JAX-RS 1.1 mode **with no changes** by the user due to the automated changes Transformation Advisor makes.\n\n  ![tWAS](images/tWAS-analyze/issues1.png)\n\n5. In summary, no code changes are required to move this application to the traditional WebSphere Base v9 runtime and the decision was taken to proceed with the operational modernization.\n\nDetailed, step-by-step instructions on how to replicate these steps are provided [here](tWAS-analyze)\n\n### Build\nThe **build** phase created the traditional WebSphere container configuration artifacts. The steps were:\n\n1. Update the generated scripts that configure the runtime environment to configure the JPA 2.0 and JAXRS 1.1 engines. The final versions of the configuration script can be found here:\n\n- [cosConfig.py](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/src/config/server_config.py)\n\n1. The containerized application was tested locally before the code and configuration files were committed to the **git** repository\n\nDetailed, step-by-step instructions on how to replicate these steps are provided [here](tWAS-build)\n\n### Deploy\nThe **deploy** phase created the OpenShift Pipelines using Tekton to deploy the application.  The pipeline builds the container and then deploys the deployment, service and route for the application.\n\nThe steps were:\n\n1. Define the Tekton pipeline to create th `Tasks`, `Pipeline` and `PipelineResources`.\n\n1. Run the pipeline manually to create the first deployment.  Eventually, the pipeline will be triggered by a webhook on each new git commit.\n\n1. Verify the pipeline. View the logs and access the application to confirm the deployment was succesful.\n\nDetailed, step-by-step instructions on how to replicate these steps are provided [here](tWAS-deploy.md)\n\n## Summary\nThis application has been modified from the initial [WebSphere ND v8.5.5 version](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was855) to run on traditional WebSphere and deployed to Red Hat OpenShift\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6fbb660b833a0e9fa0ca74de25230f73","counter":457,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Modernizing operations","description":"Moving workloads as-is to a container platform"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Modernizing operations\ndescription: Moving workloads as-is to a container platform\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\nModernizing operations<br/> <h2>Moving workloads as-is to a container platform</h2>\n  </span>\n);\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nRepackaging workloads as-is to a container without requiring development teams to make application changes.\nExplore how to move a WebSphere application to run on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with a traditional WAS container.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink>Introduction</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Application Overview </AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>How the Application was Modernized</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Analysis</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Build</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Deploy</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Introduction\n**[Operational modernization](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/op-modernization-solution)** gives an operations team the opportunity to embrace modern operations best practices without putting change requirements on the development team.\nModernizing from WebSphere Network Deployment (ND) to the **traditional WebSphere Application Server Base V9 runtime** in a container allows the application to be moved to the cloud without code changes.\n\nThe scaling, routing, clustering, high availability and continuous availability functionality that WebSphere ND was required for previously can be provided by the container runtime and allows the operations team to run cloud-native and older applications in the same environment with the same standardized logging, monitoring and security frameworks.\n\nWhile traditional WebSphere isn't a 'built for the cloud' runtime like WebSphere Liberty, it can still be run in a container and will receive the benefits of the consistency and reliability of containers as well as helping to improve DevOps and speed to market.\n\nThis type of modernization **should not require any code changes** and can be driven by the operations team.
