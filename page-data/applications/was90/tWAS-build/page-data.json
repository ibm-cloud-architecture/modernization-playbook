We aren't going to go into this much.  Since we want the DB2 and tWAS containers to be able to talk to each other we create a network they can share\n```\n$docker network create customer-order\n```\n\nNow we start DB2.  This DB2 contains scripts to populate the database with sample data for our application on startup.\n```\n$docker run -d --network customer-order --privileged=true -e LICENSE=accept -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=db2inst1 -e DBNAME=orderdb --name db2-customer-order vandepol/db2-cos\n```\nThis take a while to start up since it creates the database from scratch.\n\nto access this database from the tWAS container, we use the hostname = container name.  In this case the hostname would be `db2-customer-order`\n\nYou are going to test the image in local Docker engine. Issue the following command to start the container:\n\n```\n$docker run -d --network customer-order --name twas-customer-order -p 9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 customer-order-app:latest\n```\n\nCheck if container started successfully using command:\n\n```\n$docker logs -f 9ee253a59956869c6\nWASX7303I: The following options are passed to the scripting environment and are available as arguments that are stored in the argv variable: \"[/work/config-ibm/webContainer.props]\"\nStarting server ...................\nADMU3000I: Server server1 open for e-business; process id is 494\nHPEL is enabled\nrun logViewer.sh\n```\n\nRight now the problem we have is that the database hostname in the scripts we used to configure the application doesn't match the hostname of the db2 docker container we started.  That leads us to our next section on modifying the configuration without rebuilding the container.  We could simply modify the jython scripts and change the hostname of the databases to `db2-customer-order`, however we're going to do it using configuration files.\n\n\n## Modifying Configuration without rebuilding container\n\nWhen building the traditional WebSphere container there may be configuration you will want to add or change between environments.  You don't want to have to rebuild your container just because a database hostname changed, or for password changes.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can load configuration changes at server start-up using properties files. In this section we'll\nshow how to extract the configuration into properties files.  In the Deploy [section](tWAS-deploy.md) we'll describe how to\ncreate the configMaps and load them at server start-up when deploying using the cloudpak.\n\nWe have pre-extracted configuration files in the [runtimeConfig](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/runtimeConfig) folder, however if you want to extract your own you can follow the steps below.  \n\nWe start with a server environment setup and running with the resources defined as you desire. We can use the docker container we created above.  We can run this locally.   \n\n`docker run -d --rm --name twas-customer-order -p 9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 -p9080:9080 -v /myconfigs/:/etc/websphere/  customer-order-app:latest`  \n\nHere we expose port `9043` for the WebSphere admin console.  We also mount a volume so that we can extract the properties files we're generating locally.\n\nNext, we ssh into the container to execute commands to extract the configuration.  To enter the shell script of our container locally we run the command:  \n\n`docker exec -it twas-customer-order bash`\n\nOnce in the container shell, we execute the following commands\n\n`/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/wsadmin.sh -lang jython`  \n\nyou will be prompted for your credentials.  Use the credentials you would use in the Admin Console.\nin our example we have:`wasadmin/passw0rd`\n\nRun the following command to extract the Datasource configuration and the Password information:  \n```\nAdminTask.extractConfigProperties('[-propertiesFileName /etc/websphere/Datasource.inds.props -configData DataSource=INDS -options [[PortablePropertiesFile true]]]')\nAdminTask.extractConfigProperties('[-propertiesFileName /etc/websphere/Datasource.orderds.props -configData DataSource=OrderDS -options [[PortablePropertiesFile true]]]')\nAdminTask.extractConfigProperties('[-propertiesFileName /etc/websphere/JAASAuth.db2password.props -configData Security= -filterMechanism SELECTED_SUBTYPES -selectedSubTypes [JAASAuthData] -options [[PortablePropertiesFile true]]]')\n```\nThe syntax for these commands can get complicated.  Documentation available [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7K4U_9.0.5/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/ae/txml_7extractprops.html?origURL=SS7K4U_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/ae/txml_7extractprops.html)\n\n\n**Sample Configuration Files**  \n\n[Datasource.inds.props](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/Datasource.inds.props)  \n[Datasource.orderds.props](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/Datasource.orderds.props)  \n[JAASAuth.db2password.props](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/JAASAuth.db2password.props)\n\n\nIf we want to change something in this configuration, we can make a change to these properties files.\nTo apply this to the container we can do this at container **build** time by copying the properties file into\nthe `/work/config` folder as described in the [Modifying Artifact section](#modify-artifacts).  \n\nHowever, if you want to modify these at **deploy** time without rebuilding the docker container (ideal for passwords and database hostnames which change between environments), you can do a volume mount to\n`/etc/websphere`, and these will be applied at server start-up.  \n\nLet's try this!  \n\nOpen the properties files, `Datasource.inds.props` and `Datasource.orderds.props`.  Here let's change the server name of the database we're accessing to the name of our local db2 container we start above.   \n```\nserverName=db2-customer-order #String\n```\n\nIf our container is still running from before we want to stop it so that we can restart it and allow for the new properties to be loaded.   \n`docker stop twas-customer-order`\n\nRestart the docker container and map the properties files again. Remember to connect to the same network of the db2 container we started above\n\n`docker run -d --rm --name twas-customer-order --network customer-order -p 9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 -p 9080:9080 -v /runtimeConfigs/:/etc/websphere/ customer-order-app:guide`\n\nWe can look at the logs to see if the properties files are loaded.\n**TIP**: the properties files MUST end in .props.  it will not detect different file types in the /etc/websphere folder at server start-up.\n\n```\n$ docker logs twas-customer-order -f\nENABLE_BASIC_LOGGING is\nConfigure logging mode\nWASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected to any server process.

Certain configuration and application operations will be available in local mode.\n```\n\nHow we can log into the admin console to see our changes.  \n\n## Verify the application\n\nAfter the server is successfully started, you can connect to it using browser. Use http://localhost:9043/ibm/console to access admin console of the server running in the container. Login using your original credentials, that where migrated.\n\n![Console login](images/tWAS-build/12-console.jpg)\n\nAlso validate that application has successfully started\n\n![Application](images/tWAS-build/13-app.jpg)\n\nAnd the Datasources were also migrated\n\n![Datasources](images/tWAS-build/14-datasources.jpg)\n\nFinally open the application https://localhost:9443/CustomerOrderServicesWeb use `rbarcia/bl0wfish` for username and password if prompted.\n\n![Application page](images/tWAS-build/15-running.jpg)\n\n**You have successfully migrated application to the traditional WebSphere Application Server container. Good job!**\n\n\n## Advanced:  Put your passwords in Secrets!\n\nOne issue with the above scenario is that the contents of the [JAASAuth.db2password.props](https://github.ibm.com/CASE/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/JAASAuth.db2password.props) is in plain text (or XOR encrypted...which isn't hard to crack).  Typically, we wouldn't want to store this in a properties file, which would then be stored as a configmap in Kubernetes.  We'd want to use secrets.  The way secrets work is that the properties loaded into the secret are loaded as environment variables at container start-up.  Ideally, we would want to replace values in the properties files we've loaded above with environment variables, this is currently not supported in the cloudpak (Feature request made to development); however, we have a work around to load these values ourselves.\n\nFirst, we would replace a value with reference to an environment variable.\nLet's use that the port number as an example again.\n```\nsyncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout= #boolean\nfreeResourcesOnClose=false #String\ntraceFileCount=null\n**portNumber=!{inds.port.number} #integer**\nstripTrailingZerosForDecimalNumbers=null\ntranslateForBitData=null\nwebSphereDefaultQueryTimeout= #integer\nclientApplicationInformation= #String\n```\n\nHere we have assigned the `portNumber` to the environment variable `inds.port.number`.  \n\nWe have created a simple script to run prior to server startup which will replace all references to environment variables with the environment variable values.  \n\nThe script we created is available [here](tWAS/envsubst.sh)\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nmkdir /etc/websphere/orig\ncp /etc/websphere/*.props /etc/websphere/orig/\nfor f in $(find /etc/websphere/orig/ -regex '.*\\.props');\ndo\n  envsubst < $f > \"/etc/websphere/$(basename $f)\";\ndone\n```\n\nOne issue is that we need to install `envsubst` into the container, which is included inside the gettext package.  We have to run apt-get install to install this.  Next we need to copy our script into the container, and lastly we need to modify the startup command to run this command prior to server start-up.  Here is our solution to this:  \n\n```\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gettext\nCOPY --chown=was:0 envsubst-cmd.sh /work/\nCMD [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"/work/envsubst-cmd.sh && /work/start_server.sh\"]\n```  \n\nNow we should be able to start up the container and pass a new value as an environment variable to change the port number.\n\n`docker run -d --rm --name customer-order-app -p9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 -v /myconfigs/:/etc/websphere/ -e inds.port.number=50002 customer-order-app:latest`\n\nTo specify environment variable in the properties file you can replace the value with `${inds.port.number}`\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we've taken our estisting traditional WebSphere application.  We've loaded the container with the server and application configuration.  We've installed the application, and modified the configuration if required.  This sets us up for integrating all of this into a CI/CD pipeline and then deploying this to Kubernetes.\n\nWe're on our way to the cloud!\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0d4e70a62736ac302d160d6b080083ba","counter":471,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Modernizing operations using traditional WAS - Build","description":"This section covers how to containerize an existing application running on traditional WebSphere Application Server."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle:  Modernizing operations using traditional WAS - Build\ndescription: This section covers how to containerize an existing application running on traditional WebSphere Application Server. \n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\nModernizing operations using traditional WAS <br/> <h2>Build</h2>\n  </span>\n);\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis section covers how to containerize an existing application running on traditional WebSphere Application Server. \n\n</PageDescription>\n\nThe final versions of the files created in this section can be found in the [was90](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was90) branch of this repo\n\n## Summary:\nThis section has the following steps:\n\n\n- [Test the application locally](tWAS-build.md#test-the-image)\n- [Using environment variables in properties files to allow configuration to be injected in to the runtime environment dynamically.](tWAS-build.md#modifying-configuration-without-rebuilding-container)\n- [Advanced: put your passwords in secrets.](tWAS-build.md#advanced--put-your-passwords-in-secrets)\n\n## Build a container\n\nIBM Cloud Transformation Advisor will provide an initial set of files to simplify creating a container for the application.

We aren't going to go into this much.  Since we want the DB2 and tWAS containers to be able to talk to each other we create a network they can share\n```\n$docker network create customer-order\n```\n\nNow we start DB2.  This DB2 contains scripts to populate the database with sample data for our application on startup.\n```\n$docker run -d --network customer-order --privileged=true -e LICENSE=accept -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=db2inst1 -e DBNAME=orderdb --name db2-customer-order vandepol/db2-cos\n```\nThis take a while to start up since it creates the database from scratch.\n\nto access this database from the tWAS container, we use the hostname = container name.  In this case the hostname would be `db2-customer-order`\n\nYou are going to test the image in local Docker engine. Issue the following command to start the container:\n\n```\n$docker run -d --network customer-order --name twas-customer-order -p 9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 customer-order-app:latest\n```\n\nCheck if container started successfully using command:\n\n```\n$docker logs -f 9ee253a59956869c6\nWASX7303I: The following options are passed to the scripting environment and are available as arguments that are stored in the argv variable: \"[/work/config-ibm/webContainer.props]\"\nStarting server ...................\nADMU3000I: Server server1 open for e-business; process id is 494\nHPEL is enabled\nrun logViewer.sh\n```\n\nRight now the problem we have is that the database hostname in the scripts we used to configure the application doesn't match the hostname of the db2 docker container we started.  That leads us to our next section on modifying the configuration without rebuilding the container.  We could simply modify the jython scripts and change the hostname of the databases to `db2-customer-order`, however we're going to do it using configuration files.\n\n\n## Modifying Configuration without rebuilding container\n\nWhen building the traditional WebSphere container there may be configuration you will want to add or change between environments.  You don't want to have to rebuild your container just because a database hostname changed, or for password changes.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can load configuration changes at server start-up using properties files. In this section we'll\nshow how to extract the configuration into properties files.  In the Deploy [section](tWAS-deploy.md) we'll describe how to\ncreate the configMaps and load them at server start-up when deploying using the cloudpak.\n\nWe have pre-extracted configuration files in the [runtimeConfig](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/runtimeConfig) folder, however if you want to extract your own you can follow the steps below.  \n\nWe start with a server environment setup and running with the resources defined as you desire. We can use the docker container we created above.  We can run this locally.   \n\n`docker run -d --rm --name twas-customer-order -p 9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 -p9080:9080 -v /myconfigs/:/etc/websphere/  customer-order-app:latest`  \n\nHere we expose port `9043` for the WebSphere admin console.  We also mount a volume so that we can extract the properties files we're generating locally.\n\nNext, we ssh into the container to execute commands to extract the configuration.  To enter the shell script of our container locally we run the command:  \n\n`docker exec -it twas-customer-order bash`\n\nOnce in the container shell, we execute the following commands\n\n`/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/wsadmin.sh -lang jython`  \n\nyou will be prompted for your credentials.  Use the credentials you would use in the Admin Console.\nin our example we have:`wasadmin/passw0rd`\n\nRun the following command to extract the Datasource configuration and the Password information:  \n```\nAdminTask.extractConfigProperties('[-propertiesFileName /etc/websphere/Datasource.inds.props -configData DataSource=INDS -options [[PortablePropertiesFile true]]]')\nAdminTask.extractConfigProperties('[-propertiesFileName /etc/websphere/Datasource.orderds.props -configData DataSource=OrderDS -options [[PortablePropertiesFile true]]]')\nAdminTask.extractConfigProperties('[-propertiesFileName /etc/websphere/JAASAuth.db2password.props -configData Security= -filterMechanism SELECTED_SUBTYPES -selectedSubTypes [JAASAuthData] -options [[PortablePropertiesFile true]]]')\n```\nThe syntax for these commands can get complicated.  Documentation available [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7K4U_9.0.5/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/ae/txml_7extractprops.html?origURL=SS7K4U_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/ae/txml_7extractprops.html)\n\n\n**Sample Configuration Files**  \n\n[Datasource.inds.props](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/Datasource.inds.props)  \n[Datasource.orderds.props](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/Datasource.orderds.props)  \n[JAASAuth.db2password.props](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/JAASAuth.db2password.props)\n\n\nIf we want to change something in this configuration, we can make a change to these properties files.\nTo apply this to the container we can do this at container **build** time by copying the properties file into\nthe `/work/config` folder as described in the [Modifying Artifact section](#modify-artifacts).  \n\nHowever, if you want to modify these at **deploy** time without rebuilding the docker container (ideal for passwords and database hostnames which change between environments), you can do a volume mount to\n`/etc/websphere`, and these will be applied at server start-up.  \n\nLet's try this!  \n\nOpen the properties files, `Datasource.inds.props` and `Datasource.orderds.props`.  Here let's change the server name of the database we're accessing to the name of our local db2 container we start above.   \n```\nserverName=db2-customer-order #String\n```\n\nIf our container is still running from before we want to stop it so that we can restart it and allow for the new properties to be loaded.   \n`docker stop twas-customer-order`\n\nRestart the docker container and map the properties files again. Remember to connect to the same network of the db2 container we started above\n\n`docker run -d --rm --name twas-customer-order --network customer-order -p 9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 -p 9080:9080 -v /runtimeConfigs/:/etc/websphere/ customer-order-app:guide`\n\nWe can look at the logs to see if the properties files are loaded.\n**TIP**: the properties files MUST end in .props.  it will not detect different file types in the /etc/websphere folder at server start-up.\n\n```\n$ docker logs twas-customer-order -f\nENABLE_BASIC_LOGGING is\nConfigure logging mode\nWASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected to any server process.

Use http://localhost:9043/ibm/console to access admin console of the server running in the container. Login using your original credentials, that where migrated.\n\n![Console login](images/tWAS-build/12-console.jpg)\n\nAlso validate that application has successfully started\n\n![Application](images/tWAS-build/13-app.jpg)\n\nAnd the Datasources were also migrated\n\n![Datasources](images/tWAS-build/14-datasources.jpg)\n\nFinally open the application https://localhost:9443/CustomerOrderServicesWeb use `rbarcia/bl0wfish` for username and password if prompted.\n\n![Application page](images/tWAS-build/15-running.jpg)\n\n**You have successfully migrated application to the traditional WebSphere Application Server container. Good job!**\n\n\n## Advanced:  Put your passwords in Secrets!\n\nOne issue with the above scenario is that the contents of the [JAASAuth.db2password.props](https://github.ibm.com/CASE/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/was90/tWAS/runtimeConfigs/JAASAuth.db2password.props) is in plain text (or XOR encrypted...which isn't hard to crack).  Typically, we wouldn't want to store this in a properties file, which would then be stored as a configmap in Kubernetes.  We'd want to use secrets.  The way secrets work is that the properties loaded into the secret are loaded as environment variables at container start-up.  Ideally, we would want to replace values in the properties files we've loaded above with environment variables, this is currently not supported in the cloudpak (Feature request made to development); however, we have a work around to load these values ourselves.\n\nFirst, we would replace a value with reference to an environment variable.\nLet's use that the port number as an example again.\n```\nsyncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout= #boolean\nfreeResourcesOnClose=false #String\ntraceFileCount=null\n**portNumber=!{inds.port.number} #integer**\nstripTrailingZerosForDecimalNumbers=null\ntranslateForBitData=null\nwebSphereDefaultQueryTimeout= #integer\nclientApplicationInformation= #String\n```\n\nHere we have assigned the `portNumber` to the environment variable `inds.port.number`.  \n\nWe have created a simple script to run prior to server startup which will replace all references to environment variables with the environment variable values.  \n\nThe script we created is available [here](tWAS/envsubst.sh)\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nmkdir /etc/websphere/orig\ncp /etc/websphere/*.props /etc/websphere/orig/\nfor f in $(find /etc/websphere/orig/ -regex '.*\\.props');\ndo\n  envsubst < $f > \"/etc/websphere/$(basename $f)\";\ndone\n```\n\nOne issue is that we need to install `envsubst` into the container, which is included inside the gettext package.  We have to run apt-get install to install this.  Next we need to copy our script into the container, and lastly we need to modify the startup command to run this command prior to server start-up.  Here is our solution to this:  \n\n```\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gettext\nCOPY --chown=was:0 envsubst-cmd.sh /work/\nCMD [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"/work/envsubst-cmd.sh && /work/start_server.sh\"]\n```  \n\nNow we should be able to start up the container and pass a new value as an environment variable to change the port number.\n\n`docker run -d --rm --name customer-order-app -p9443:9443 -p 9043:9043 -v /myconfigs/:/etc/websphere/ -e inds.port.number=50002 customer-order-app:latest`\n\nTo specify environment variable in the properties file you can replace the value with `${inds.port.number}`\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we've taken our estisting traditional WebSphere application.  We've loaded the container with the server and application configuration.  We've installed the application, and modified the configuration if required.  This sets us up for integrating all of this into a CI/CD pipeline and then deploying this to Kubernetes.\n\nWe're on our way to the cloud!\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/modernization-playbook/modernization-playbook/src/pages/applications/was90/tWAS-build.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1054721580","1054721580","1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
