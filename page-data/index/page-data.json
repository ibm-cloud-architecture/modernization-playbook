The term is used broadly and can refer to simply lifting and shifting VMs into a Cloud infrastructure but also extends as far as refactoring applications to leverage new architectural patterns such as microservices or event driven architectures.  The goal is to leverage your existing people, practices and technologies and evolve them towards proven patterns that capture the benefits of developing, deploying and operating in a Cloud environment.\n\n\n## Overview\n\n### What is impacted when you modernize?\n\nModernization impacts a broad set of architecture domains as you evolve and mature more towards a cloud-native approach.
