## Introduction
In this phase the JEE6 EJB code is modernized to use MicroProfile and is then able to run on the latest open source version of Liberty (OpenLiberty)

### Move the backend monolith to OpenLiberty

  ![Step 5](images/step5.png)

### Run this solution
Use the following steps to run this solution locally on Docker

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/application-modernization-javaee-quarkus.git && cd application-modernization-javaee-quarkus
$ ROOT_FOLDER=$(pwd)
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/build-and-run-monolith-db2.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/build-and-run-splitted-frontend-open.sh
```

## Summary
This application has been refactored in a series of steps from the original [WebSphere ND v8.5.5 version](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was855) to run as Micro Services on Red Hat OpenShift.
