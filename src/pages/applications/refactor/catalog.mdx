## Introduction
In this phase the backend application was analyzed and the Catalog service was identified as a candidate to be extracted in to it's own Micro Service. The code was strangled from the monolith and deployed using Quarkus
### Refactor the Catalog service to Quarkus

### Run this solution
Use the following steps to run this solution locally on Docker

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/application-modernization-javaee-quarkus.git && cd application-modernization-javaee-quarkus
$ ROOT_FOLDER=$(pwd)
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/build-and-run-monolith-db2.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/run-database-postgres-catalog.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/run-kafka.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/build-and-run-catalog.sh
```

## Summary
This application has been refactored in a series of steps from the original [WebSphere ND v8.5.5 version](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was855) to run as Micro Services on Red Hat OpenShift.
