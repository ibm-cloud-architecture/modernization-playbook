## Introduction
Once the monolith is containerized the application owners may choose to separate the frontend application code (DOJO based) from the monolith's EAR file in to a separately deployable component. With the front and backend separated they can be developed, tested and deployed independently.

## Summary
This application has been refactored in a series of steps from the original [WebSphere ND v8.5.5 version](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was855) to run as Micro Services on Red Hat OpenShift.
